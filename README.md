# BibleClubWebsite
This will include all the html/css/js/php/sql for your first web-development application for your Monday Night Bible Group Sessions.
The learning objective of this project is to get familiar with vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and SQL.

Learning Outcomes for Next Project:
1. Think before programming, this project has too much unnessary and nested divs.
2. Think of using frameworks, they reduce code and the amount of debugging time.
3. Think of a very good naming convention for elements and get used to copy and pasting variables where needed instead of on memorization (reduces debugging time).
4. Do not inject workflow with JS but link documents to JS.
5. Limit comments in document (code should be self-explanatory). Small comments in classes/functions. Big comments prior to classes/functions. Largest comments on top of each document.
6. Get better with GitHub, think of a better way to push updates.
7. Always try to fix with plain CSS before overriding with JS.
